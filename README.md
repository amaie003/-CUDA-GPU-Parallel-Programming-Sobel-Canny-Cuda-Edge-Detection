# CUDA GPU Parallel Programming - Sobel Canny Edge Detection
Please see "Report.pdf" for detail description of this project. 

## Compile and Run
Required Library/ Technology: OpenCV, CUDA
For convenience of finding testing images, no parameter input is needed when testing the application.
When the program is compiled and executed, it runs a sample image named 12.jpg that is located in
the same folder and displays the final result of the application on the screen. Then, the result should
should should the time taken when running the canny version of the application as well as the resulted image.
